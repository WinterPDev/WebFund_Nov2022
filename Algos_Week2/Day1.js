// Math library lets us do a series of Math functions built into JS, we do not need to install anything to use Math.

// Floor will always round down, even if greater than .5.
var floor = Math.floor(1.8);
// Ciel will always round up, even if lower than .5
var ceiling = Math.ceil(Math.PI);

// random will get a random value in the range of 0.01 and 0.99
var random = Math.random();

console.log(floor);
console.log(ceiling);
console.log(random);

// Checking withina 1 in 6 chance, how can we use random to check against 6 possible numbers?
function d6() {
    var roll = Math.random();
    // your code here
    return roll;
}

var playerRoll = d6();
console.log("The player rolled: " + playerRoll);
